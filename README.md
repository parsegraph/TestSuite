# parsegraph-testsuite

This module contains a TestSuite class, which manages
a suite of tests. Multiple tests across files can be automatically
added to a root test called AllTests.

This module is superseded in Node environments with frameworks like
Mocha and Jest, so it is in the process of being removed from Parsegraph
modules.
